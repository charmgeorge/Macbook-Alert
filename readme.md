This guy [Nick](https://github.com/nickbouldien)  really needs a macbooks or whatever. This will start out as weather app so I can practice and understand Angular.js. Then later on it will turn into a notify Nick about macbooks app.

API Key for the weather app can be found here [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The documentation for the call used can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/current#one)

To try it out you will need to create a config.js file and enter your API key into an object like this:

var config = {
  MY_KEY : "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
